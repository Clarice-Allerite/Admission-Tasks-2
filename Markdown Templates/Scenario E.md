Upon checking you progress, you have already completed up to the Challenge 4(Build your Stats). We have highlighted the remaining Challenges that you need to finish for you to complete your application. You can also go to the [CodePath WEB102 Prework Site](https://defiant-apparel.surge.sh/), which contains all the instructions for completing challenges.

When your prework is complete, here is the steps in Submtting your Prework:
> **Step 1: Preparing for Submission**
>> All submissions happen via Github and we require each submission to follow a particular format, including a clearly documented README with a list of completed features and a GIF website walkthrough. Once you have completed these challenges and pushed your code to GitHub with the README and GIF walkthrough included, you'll submit the project.
>> Use this README TEMPLATE that is already included in the GitHub Repo you forked.

>>It is important that you follow the same layout as the README template so that we can easily access your work.
>>Be sure to check off each feature that is implemented in your submission by changing [ ] to [x].

> **Step 2: Review the Submission Checklist**
Please review the following checklist to ensure your submission is valid:

>> * Can you view the game stats in the dashboard at the top of the Sea Monster website?
>> * Can you use the "Show Unfunded Only" and "Show Funded Only" buttons to view filtered versions of the game list?
>> * Did you successfully push your code to GitHub? Can you see the code on GitHub?
>> * Did you complete the README.md in the repo on GitHub?
>> * Does your README include a GIF walkthrough of the site's functionality?
>> * Did you visit your application dashboard and submit using the pre-work form?
>> 
>If the answer to all items is YES, then you are ready to add the prework to your application!

> **Step 3: Adding the Prework to Your Application**

>>Once you have completed all required challenges and added a README as described above, your next step is to notify us that you are ready for a Prework review. To submit, go to the [application submission form](https://apply.codepath.org/members/login/?next=/prework/). *(IMPORTANT: Make sure you sign in with your CodePath-registered GitHub account!)*
