### Scenario A: Request to Bump up to Advance Track
---

Hi John, 

We acknowledge your exceptional grade as a sophomore in MIT, and we would like to thank you for your interest in applying for the **Advanced Technical Interview Prep (TIP103)**.We also noted your request to transfer to Advance Track.

However, we want to admit you based on your technical interview skills, and we do not want to put you in a class that is too advanced or too basic for you so you can get the best experience possible in this program. 

Unfortunately, based on your pre-work score, you only qualifies for the beginner track. With this regard, we regret to inform you that your request to transfer to the Advanced Track has been denied.

Thank you for your time and patience with this matter.

*Sincerely,*
Clarice C. Allerite
Admission Staff
