### Scenario D: Tech Fellow is following up on their status
---

Dear Dennis,

Thank you for your inquiry about the status of your application. We apologies for the delay.

We have reviewed the application and it is duly noted that you have already completed all your requirements for this Tech Fellow application three weeks ago. However, before we can admit a tech fellow into the tech fellow training , there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed their requirements as well. At this time, your application is still in the process and we won't be able to admit you until there are at least two (2) who completed the admissions requirements.

The waiting process sometimes takes close to a month. We will keep your updated until then.

If you have any other questions or concerns, we are happy to provide you further assistance. 

Thank you.

*Sincerely,*
Clarice Allerite
Admission Staff
