Dear Jane, 

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience and confusion regarding the eligibility requirements.

We want to take this matter seriously and we already assessed our eligibility requirements criteria. We guaranteed that the eligibility criteria for our courses are defined on our [Web page](https://www.codepath.org/courses). In addition, we made sure that our applications have a section for eligibility checks before the application submission.


We reviewed your application and based on the information that you have provided to us, you are living in Thailand and are not currently enrolled in the US college or university. As per the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, we regret to inform you that our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. Furthermore, Codepath currently runs classes in Haiti and Taiwan, and we might be expanding to other countries but not as of yet. 

We truly appreciate your effort in building your pre-work app and we also value your enthusiasm in applying to this program. Unfortunately, we cannot proceed with your application because of the eligibility requirements. Also, we apologies that we cannot make any exemption as we want to be fair to all the applicants.

Thank you for your time and I ask for your understanding in this matter. 

*Sincerely,*
Clarice C. Allerite
Admission Staff
