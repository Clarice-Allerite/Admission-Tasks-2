Dear Anne, 

Thank you for showing your interest in our Summer Prep Course. However, we cannot proceed with your application because you have missed the deadline which was 2 weeks ago. Moreover, as of this moment, the class is full and we already have a long waitlist. 

We acknowledge your dedication in applying for internship programs. With that, we want to share with you our [high-level software interview guide](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus) that contains tips and guidelines that you might find helpful. If you want to learn more, you can also check our [resources page](https://www.codepath.org/dev-resources) and sign up for our mailing list in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.

Thank you once again. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors. 

*Sincerely,*
Clarice Allerite
Admissions Staff
